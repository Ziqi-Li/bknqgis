Version 0.2.0
-------------

Improvements:

* Complete overhaul of the documentation
* Addition of ``overlay`` to perform spatial overlays with polygons (#142)
* Addition of ``sjoin`` to perform spatial joins (#115, #145, #188)
* Addition of ``__geo_interface__`` that returns a python data structure
  to represent the ``GeoSeries`` as a GeoJSON-like ``FeatureCollection`` (#116)
  and ``iterfeatures`` method (#178)
* Addition of the ``explode`` (#146) and ``dissolve`` (#310, #311) methods.
* Addition of the ``sindex`` attribute, a Spatial Index using the optional
  dependency ``rtree`` (``libspatialindex``) that can be used to speed up
  certain operations such as overlays (#140, #141).
* Addition of the ``GeoSeries.ix`` coordinate indexer to slice a GeoSeries based
  on a bounding box of the coordinates (#55).
* Improvements to plotting: ability to specify edge colors (#173), support for
  the ``vmin``, ``vmax``, ``figsize``, ``linewidth`` keywords (#207), legends
  for chloropleth plots (#210), color points by specifying a colormap (#186) or
  a single color (#238).
* Larger flexibility of ``to_crs``, accepting both dicts and proj strings (#289)
* Addition of embedded example data, accessible through
  ``geopandas.datasets.get_path``.

API changes:

* In the ``plot`` method, the ``axes`` keyword is renamed to ``ax`` for
  consistency with pandas, and the ``colormap`` keyword is renamed to ``cmap``
  for consistency with matplotlib (#208, #228, #240).

Bug fixes:

* Properly handle rows with missing geometries (#139, #193).
* Fix ``GeoSeries.to_json`` (#263).
* Correctly serialize metadata when pickling (#199, #206).
* Fix ``merge`` and ``concat`` to return correct GeoDataFrame (#247, #320, #322).
